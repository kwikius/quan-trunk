    This example shows how it is possible to use integer value_types,
    in different units without loss of precision (eg int 1/1000)
    up in the code at compile time the function attempts to decide 
    how to do the adds, subs, divs and muls to give best resolution. 

    NB Only works accurately for coherent-quantities.
    (for incoherent-quantities use a floating point value_type).
